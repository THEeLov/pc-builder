# PcAssemblies

## Project Description:
The system allows the user to select and configure a PC assembly. It starts by selecting office, gaming, work, high-end. Accordingly, it will display the basic build for that selection. Users the option to change the processor, operating memory, graphics card and possibly add peripherals or something from the additional menu to the PC. Each operation checks for part compatibility between the selected items (processors and motherboards, RAM speed, ...). Give options to change corresponding to the category. Based on the selection, the user is always shown the calculated price of the build and can request a summary with the configuration.

## Functionalities:
### Must have:
- the database should track at least 6 entities
- components are stored persistently
- listings can be sorted, filtered
- each configuration must be validated
- each pc component must have an image
- user can choose a predefined configuration that can be customized
- administrator can add predefined configurations
- administrator can create and delete components
- when the configuration is complete, a summary is displayed to the user

## Integrate with editors

Enhance your Nx experience by installing [Nx Console](https://nx.dev/nx-console) for your favorite editor. Nx Console
provides an interactive UI to view your projects, run tasks, generate code, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and
comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Start the application

Run `npx nx dev pc-assemblies` to start the development server. Happy coding!

## Build for production

Run `npx nx build pc-assemblies` to build the application. The build artifacts are stored in the output directory (e.g. `dist/` or `build/`), ready to be deployed.

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
npx nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks).

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/nx-cloud/features/distribute-task-execution)

## Explore the project graph

Run `npx nx graph` to show the graph of the workspace.
It will show tasks that you can run with Nx.
